# HRP-RE40_case
This repository includes a test system for the receiving-end power system. The system is based on the practical power system in southeast China.
## 20240711 Version 0.1
We create this case for the research about the evolution of the receiving-end power system under the low-carbon target.
This is the version 0.1. We will improve the test system later.
If you have any problem, please contact me by mails.
The name of this case is HRP-RE40. The name may be changed in the later version. 

The excel file we have uploaded is in Chinese, and we will launch the English version in the future. This file can be solved directly by the software GTEP which is developed by Tsinghua University. The case in other formats (e.g. .mat) may be included.
